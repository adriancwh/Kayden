        <h1>About ME!</h1>
        <span>My name is Kayden Chong. I was born in the early morning of <u>28th October 2016</u>. My daddy told me I was crying when I first saw the world! I was so scared of the bright lights and the strangers I saw.</span>
        <span>But once mommy held onto me, I felt really comfortable and knew at that moment I would be safe and protected from all the evils of the world!</span>
        <span>Daddy told me my birth weight was 2.95kg, and that I was a long baby! They made sure I was healthy before I could see mommy and daddy again.</span>
        <span>I love my mommy and daddy!</span>
